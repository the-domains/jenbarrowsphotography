In old English, homestead means settlement, in the sense that a settlement is a community that is united through the land. This project explores the community where I grew up in central Maine. It is an area that has been hard hit by the economic downturn that continues to affect the prosperity of year round residents and is located in a state with the oldest population per capita. By 2030, without intervention, one quarter of the population will be over the age of 65\. I am interested in how this aging population shapes the economic and social opportunities of my hometown and its surrounding community.
